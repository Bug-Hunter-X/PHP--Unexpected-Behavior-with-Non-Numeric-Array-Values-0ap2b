This repository contains a PHP function that calculates the average of an array of numbers.  The original function has a bug where it does not correctly handle cases where the input array contains non-numeric values.  The bug is demonstrated with the example code, which shows the function failing when encountering strings or other non-numeric data. A solution is proposed that addresses this bug, making the function robust and reliable for various input conditions. This solution adds explicit type checking and error handling to ensure that the average calculation is performed only with valid numeric values.
